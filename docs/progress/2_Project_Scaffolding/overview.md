# Step 2: Project Scaffolding

## Purpose
To set up the initial React project structure using Vite and TypeScript within the Docker container.

## Process
1.  **Placeholder `package.json`**: A temporary `package.json` file was created to allow the Docker image to build successfully. The `Dockerfile` expects this file to exist to run `npm install`.
2.  **Scaffolding in a Subdirectory**: The `npm create vite@latest` command was run inside the container to scaffold the project in a temporary subdirectory named `app-scaffold`. This was done to avoid the interactive prompt that Vite shows when the target directory is not empty.
3.  **Moving Files**: The contents of the `app-scaffold` directory were then moved to the root of the application directory.
4.  **Cleanup**: The temporary `app-scaffold` directory was removed.

## Result
The project now has the standard Vite + React + TypeScript project structure in the root directory, and is ready for development.
