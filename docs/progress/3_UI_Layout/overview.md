# Step 3: Basic UI Layout

## Purpose
To create the initial user interface layout with placeholder components for the main application areas.

## Process
1.  **Cleared Boilerplate**: The default boilerplate code was removed from `src/App.tsx` and `src/App.css`.
2.  **Created Placeholders**: The `App.tsx` component was updated to include placeholder `div` elements for the following components:
    -   `keyboard-visualization`: Will display the interactive keyboard.
    -   `practice-area`: Will contain the text for typing practice.
    -   `performance-panel`: Will show typing metrics like WPM and accuracy.
3.  **Styled Layout**: The `App.css` file was updated with basic CSS Grid rules to arrange the placeholder components in a logical layout.
4.  **Installed Dependencies**: Ran `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies for the React application.

## Result
The application now has a basic visual structure. The placeholder components are arranged on the page, ready to be replaced with functional components in the upcoming steps.
