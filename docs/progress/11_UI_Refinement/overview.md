# Step 11: UI Refinement and Keyboard Scaling

## Purpose

To improve the overall layout and user experience of the application by reorganizing the main components, adding a sidebar, and increasing the size of the keyboard visualization.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Layout Restructuring

-   **New HTML Structure**: The main application layout in `src/App.tsx` was restructured to use a two-column design. A new `.app-container` was introduced to wrap the main content and the sidebar.
-   **Sidebar**: An `<aside>` element with the class `.sidebar` was added to house the file loader and performance panel, positioning them on the right side of the page.
-   **Main Content**: The practice area and keyboard visualization were grouped into a `<main>` element with the class `.app-main`, which now occupies the central area of the page.

### 2. CSS Refinements

-   **Flexbox Layout**: The main `.app` container was updated to use a flexbox layout with `justify-content: space-between` to correctly position the main content and the sidebar.
-   **Centered Main Content**: The `.app-main` class was updated with `margin: 0 auto` to ensure it remains centered in the available space.
-   **Header Adjustments**: The font size of the main header was reduced, and its alignment was set to `center`.

### 3. Keyboard Scaling

-   **Container Resizing**: The `min-width` and `min-height` of the `.keyboard-visualization` container in `src/App.css` were doubled to accommodate a larger keyboard.
-   **SVG `viewBox` Adjustment**: The `viewBox` attribute of the SVG element in `src/components/Keyboard.tsx` was adjusted to `0 0 1200 500` to control the zoom level and ensure the entire keyboard is visible.
-   **Removed `transform`**: The `transform="scale(2)"` attribute was removed from the SVG in favor of the more precise `viewBox` adjustment.

## Result

The application now has a more organized and visually appealing layout. The main content is centered, the sidebar is correctly positioned on the right, and the keyboard visualization is significantly larger and easier to read, all while being fully contained within its designated area.
